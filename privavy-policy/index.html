<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Poke ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
Poke is designed with a local-first approach. Your reminders, lists, and preferences are stored on your device. We do not collect or have access to your reminder data unless you opt into cloud sync (premium feature).
</p>

<h2>Local Data</h2>
<p>
All reminder data, lists, tags, and app preferences are stored locally on your device using a SQLite database. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to enable cloud sync.
</p>

<h2>Cloud Sync (Premium)</h2>
<p>
If you subscribe to Poke Pro and enable cloud sync, your reminder data will be securely transmitted and stored on our servers to enable cross-device synchronization. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>
Poke uses local notifications to remind you of your tasks. Notification permissions are requested separately and can be revoked at any time through your device settings.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
We may use third-party services for analytics, error tracking, and payment processing. These services have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to review them.
</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>
You have the right to access, modify, or delete your data at any time. Since your data is stored locally, you have full control. You can delete all data by uninstalling the app.
</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at dpertsin@gmail.com.
